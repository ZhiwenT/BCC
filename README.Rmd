# BCCLong

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BCCLong is to compute a Bayesian Consensus Clustering (BCC) model 
for mixed-type longitudinal data

## Description

Statistical methods for clustering a single longitudinal trajectory have been well-developed and widely used in many different medical research areas. However, it is very common these days to encounter situations where several longitudinal markers or responses are collected simultaneously in a study and there is a growing interest to examine how multiple longitudinal characteristics could collectively contribute to disaggregating disease heterogeneity. Therefore, the `BCClong` package has been created.
`BCClong` is an R package for performing Bayesian Consensus Clustering (BCC) model for clustering continuous, discrete and categorical longitudinal data, which are commonly seen in many clinical studies [Lu et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9225). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of BCC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZhiwenT/BCClong", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("BCClong")
```

## Overview

To list all the functions available in the package:

```r
ls("package:BCClong")
```

Currently, there are 1 function __*BCC.multi*__ in this package which will provide a summary statistics for the computed model.

An overview of the package is illustrated below:
