# BCCLong

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BCCLong is to compute a Bayesian Consensus Clustering (BCC) model 
for mixed-type longitudinal data

## Description

`BCClong` is an R package for performing Bayesian Consensus Clustering (BCC) model for clustering continuous, discrete and categorical longitudinal data, which are commonly seen in many clinical studies [Lu et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9225). Statistical methods for clustering a single longitudinal trajectory have been well-developed and widely used in many different medical research areas. However, it is very common these days to encounter situations where several longitudinal markers or responses are collected simultaneously in a study and there is a growing interest to examine how multiple longitudinal characteristics could collectively contribute to disaggregating disease heterogeneity. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of BCC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZhiwenT/BCClong")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BCClong)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
